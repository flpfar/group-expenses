# Group Expenses
 > A simple way of grouping expenses from different users, built on Ruby on Rails.

This simple app allows you to group your expenses with other users and shows the total of each group. The groups are shared globally, meaning that any registered user can see and add new expenses inside a group.
The interface aims at mobile phones, so there may be design issues on desktop version.
